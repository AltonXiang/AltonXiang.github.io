## About Me

I'm a M.Sc of Statistics in School of Data Science,  <a href="https://www.fudan.edu.cn/" target="_blank"> Fudan University </a>,
working under the mentorship of Prof.<a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=UxH6ELwAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN" target="_blank"> Rujun Jiang </a>. My research involves the application of fintech based on machine learning in various aspects, such as stock returns prediction and financial fraud detection. In addition, I am currently interested in end-to-end portfolio optimization.

I studied international economics and trade in School of Economics, Fudan University when I was an undergraduate, so I have a deep understanding of the frontier knowledge of finance. The machine-learning and mathematical knowledge of Statistics also helps me improve my ability of quantitative analysis.


Outside of academia, I prefer to exert my abilities in the field of quantitative investment. I have been an avid fan of Chelsea Football Club for over 10 years. I also play football frequently and once won the honor of Assist King of the football match in the School of Economics.
